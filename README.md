I made all my parts and assemblies in one Onshape Document found [here](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/eae5dc97217fca81185a1770/w/6e9210f9cafca1a231e8f307/e/2ec7064764dfcd987c577c06)

# Week 5 challenge: Rotating Cube
For this assignment, we were given the dimensions to a cube, spinner shaft, and brackets. We then had to assemble them in a way that would allow the cube to spin a full 360 degrees and allow the spinner shafts to rotate without any problems.
